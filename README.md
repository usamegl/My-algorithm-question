# MyAlgorithmQuestion
My question: I have defined a class named account. This class has two double properties named number1 and number2.
This class also has two more properties called total, subtract.
These properties hold the values ​​of number1 and number2.
calculation(double a, double b) performs the assignment of number 1 and number 2.
The method called sum() is not dependent on a type, it adds number1 and number2 and gives its output.
The method named subtract() does not depend on a type, it subtracts number1 and number2 and gives its output.
The method named KokAl() does not depend on a type and takes the root of number1 and number2 and outputs it.
The method named Show() does not depend on a type, it calls the KokAl() method and provides the necessary operations.
The method called KupAl() does not depend on a type, it takes the cube of number1 and number2 and outputs it.
Finally, the question is completed by taking the necessary inputs from the main group of the class named Question and calling the necessary methods.
